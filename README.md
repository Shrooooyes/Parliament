# Parliament System

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified version of the Indian Parliament system, with functionalities for creating legislative bodies like Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, electing the President, adding members to the houses, passing bills, and converting them into laws. This project is implemented in **Python**, **C++**, **Java**, and **C#**, maintaining the same functionality across all four languages.

## Features

- **Bill Passing**: Introduce bills in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha and pass them through both houses.
- **Law Formation**: Once approved by both houses, the President can sign the bill into law.
- **Display**: Show members of each house, the President, and the list of bills.
